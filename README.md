# HERE4U
This project that was done for the Seneca May 2023 Hackathon. Me and my partner <a href="https://github.com/Sunraj751">Sunraj Sharma</a> worked on the category "Student Experince" and developed a proof of concept app for online therapy targeted towards students that uses their school funded insurance. It also works as a portal or hub for to monitor and track your school insurance coverage (dental, health, ect.)
